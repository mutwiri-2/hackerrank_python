# Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x,y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. Here, 0<=i<=x; 0<=j<=y; 0<=k<=z

# Input Format
# Four integers x,y,z  and n each on four separate lines, respectively.

# Constraints
# Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

# Sample Input 0

# 1
# 1
# 1
# 2
# Sample Output 0

# [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
